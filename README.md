## Description 

The project was to create an easier way to view a development team on a single page of html.  It was to be a backend node application.  It also had several npm packages to prompt through a series of questions. The questions were similar for each employee with the exception of one that was different based on the role of the employee being entered into the system.  The general questions were asking for a name, id number, and email address. Then a job specific question was prompted for the manager it was the number of the office, the engineer was asked for a github, and lastly the intern was asked what school they went to.  After the general and specific questions were answered the user would then be prompted to add additional employees. If they wanted to add another employee they would be prompt through the questions again.  If they were done entering employees, then the application would render the data through a html renderer function and each of the employees would be made into corresponding cards. The app will run through every employee and then generate a html page that will display all the employees.
